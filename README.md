# Polynomial-Calculator
This project represents a polynomial calculator in which the user can write as inputs two polynomials and select a mathematical operation. The result will be presented in a text box at
the end of the application window. The division operation isn't implemented. The scope of the project was to exemplify the use of Java Swing and Java Regex.  The project was written 
entirely in Java.
